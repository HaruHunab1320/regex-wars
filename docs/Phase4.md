# Phase 4: Advanced Features & Game Modes

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks  
**Priority**: Expand core experience with additional game modes and features  
**Dependencies**: Requires completed Phase 1, 2, & 3

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Objectives

Transform the single-player learning experience into a comprehensive regex mastery platform with multiple game modes, competitive elements, and advanced features. This phase focuses on replayability, community engagement, and providing different ways to practice and enjoy regex skills.

## ðŸŽ® Game Modes Overview

### 1. Arena Mode - Competitive Regex Racing
Real-time multiplayer battles where players compete to clear patterns faster than opponents.

### 2. Defense Mode - Tower Defense with Regex
Use regex patterns as defensive filters against waves of incoming "malicious" text attacks.

### 3. Zen Mode - Relaxed Practice Environment
Stress-free environment for experimentation and skill refinement without time pressure.

### 4. Challenge Mode - Community-Generated Puzzles
Player-created challenges and daily/weekly puzzle competitions.

### 5. Speedrun Mode - Time Attack Challenges
Optimized levels designed for competitive speedrunning with leaderboards.
